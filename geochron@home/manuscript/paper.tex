\begin{abstract}
Fission track geochronology is based on the visual analysis of optical
images. This visual process is prone to observer bias. Fission track
datasets are currently reported as small data tables. The
interpretation of these tables requires a high degree of trust between
the fission track analyst and the user of the data. geochron@home is
software that removes this requirement of trust. It combines a
browser-based `virtual microscope' with an online database to provide
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible) access to
fission track data.\medskip

geochron@home serves four different purposes. It can be used (1) to
count fission tracks in `private mode', i.e. hidden from other users
on the internet; (2) to archive fission track images and counts for
inspection by other users; (3) to create tutorials for new students of
the fission track method; and (4) to generate crowd-sourced fission
track data, by serving randomly selected selections of images to
citizen scientists. We illustrate these four applications with
examples that demonstrate (1) geochron@home's ability to compare and
combine fission track counts for multiple users within a lab group;
(2) the use of the geochron@home archive in the peer review system;
(3) the effectiveness of even simple tutorials in teaching novice
users how to count fission tracks; and (4) the `wisdom of crowds' in
fission track identification.\medskip

geochron@home was written in Python and PostgreSQL. Its code is freely
available for inspection and modification, allowing users to set up
their own geochron@home server. Alternatively, users who would like to
upload data to the GaHa, but do not have the facilities to set up
their own server, may use the server at University College London free
of charge. The GaHa accepts image stacks acquired on any type of
digital microscope, and accomodates fission track data (counts and
length measurements) from external fission track analysis suites such
as Fission Track Studio and Track\emph{Flow}.\medskip

We anticipate that the introduction of FAIR workflows will make
fission track data more accurate and more future proof. Storing
fission track data online will benefit future developments in fission
track thermochronology. For example, archival datasets of peer
reviewed fission track counts can be used to train and improve machine
learning algorithms for automated fission track analysis. We hope that
other geochronological methods will follow the fission track
community's lead in FAIR data processing, with benefits to all the
other Earth Science disciplines that depend on geochronological data.
\end{abstract}

\introduction\label{sec:intro}

Science is on an irreversible trajectory towards greater
openness. Geochronology is no exception to this trend, as this journal
illustrates with its open access and review policies. Funding agencies
increasingly demand that research results and data are shared with the
public. Currently, geochronological data are generally provided as
flat tables of dates or isotopic ratio estimates. However, in other
fields of science such as physics, it is common practice to share the
raw unprocessed measurements along with processing instructions
\citep[e.g.,][]{abbott2016}. This paper moves geochronology in the
same direction. It presents a mechanism to generate and store fully
FAIR \citep[Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
  Reproducible;][]{wilkinson2016} data in the context of fission track
analysis.\medskip

Unlike most other geochronometers, which use mass spectrometers to
estimate parent-daughter ratios, fission tracks are observed under an
optical microscope and counted by a human observer.  In recent years,
digital microscopy has moved fission track data acquisition from the
objective lens of a microscope to the computer screen
\citep{gleadow2009, vanranst2019, gleadow2019}. Ongoing developments
in artificial intelligence generate further opportunities to improve
the throughput and accuracy of fission track data
\citep{nachtergaele2020}. But despite the richness of the digital
datasets produced by these novel tools, fission track data are still
reported as small summary tables. These tables require an unnecessary
degree of trust between the `producer' and `consumer' of the
data.\medskip

geochron@home is a free and open software platform that allows
geochronologists to share their raw fission track data over the
internet for perusal by peer reviewers, colleagues and the general
public. geochron@home is a virtual petrographic microscope connected to a
database with digital image stacks of etched fission track
samples. The platform can be used to acquire, archive and inspect
fission track data in full adherence to the FAIR data principles. In
Section~\ref{sec:architecture}, we will describe geochron@home's software
architecture in five steps. We will show that this architecture
accommodates imagery from any type of digital microscope. It enables
flexible workflows that can be adapted to four different
applications.\medskip

Using image stacks of Mount Dromedary apatite, we will show how
geochron@home can be used to count fission tracks in `private mode'
(Section~\ref{sec:private}); to archive published fission track
datasets in `public mode' (Section~\ref{sec:GaHa}); to build tutorials
for training purposes (Section~\ref{sec:tutorial}); and to
crowd-source fission track data on the internet
(Section~\ref{sec:crowdsourcing}). Because geochron@home is free and
open, it can be extended and improved by any interested party. We make
some suggestions for future improvements in
Section~\ref{sec:outlook}. We hope that the geochron@home's example
will be followed in other geochronological disciplines, as this will
benefit not only geochronology itself, but all the other disciplines
that depend on it (Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}).

\section{Workflow}\label{sec:architecture}

The geochron@home workflow separates the acquisition of
microscope images from their analysis, providing the flexibility to
accommodate data from different microscope manufacturers, which
typically come with their own instrument control software. The
workflow can be broken down into five steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquisition of z-stacks of microscope images in reflected and
  transmitted light for each of the grains in a sample and,
  optionally, for the accompanying external detector
  (Figure~\ref{fig:EDM}). At University College London, this first
  step is currently accomplished by a Python macro within Zeiss' Zen
  Blue software.  However, geochron@home can also accommodate imagery
  from other platforms, such as Fission Track Studio
  \citep[Zeiss;][]{gleadow2009} and Track\emph{Flow}
  \citep[Nikon;][]{vanranst2019}.

\item Prepare the z-stacks for uploading to the geochron@home
  database. This database requires that the images are organised as a
  nested sequence of directories, in which a `project' consists of
  `samples' that comprise a number of `grains'.  Each grain
  corresponds to a numbered sequence of \texttt{.jpeg} images, one for
  each layer of the z-stack. Note that the raw microscope images are
  generally not stored as \texttt{.jpeg} files but in uncompressed
  \texttt{.czi} (for Zen Blue), \texttt{.tif} (for Fission Track
  Studio) or \texttt{.nd2} (for Nikon/Track\emph{Flow})
  formats. Conversion from these raw images to sequences of
  \texttt{.jpeg} files is done with a shell script using Imagemagick
  \citep{still2006}.\medskip

In addition to the sequence of \texttt{.jpeg} images, a low level
`grain' folder can also include an optional file called
\texttt{roi.json} containing the vertices of a default region of
interest for spontaneous (and/or induced) track counting. The database
structure can also accommodate existing fission track counting
results.  For example, if a user has already counted their fission
tracks in Fission Track Studio, then they can store those results in a
\texttt{.json} file at the `sample' level directory. Because Fission
Track Studio stores its results in an \texttt{.xml} format, a second
conversion script is needed to translate those results into an
equivalent \texttt{.json} format.

\item Upload the data to the geochron@home platform. geochron@home is
  a Django web-app with a PostgreSQL database. The database can be
  accessed via a Python API and a (more limited) web-based GUI
  interface. Accessing the API requires administrator
  privileges. Administrators can create projects, samples and grains;
  download data; and set the access rights of `ordinary' users.
  Projects can be private or public. The source code and installation
  instructions for geochron@home are freely available over GitHub (see
  the Data Availability statement at the end of this paper). This
  allows fission track users to set up their own
  server. Alternatively, fission track labs can upload their data to
  the UCL server by contacting the corresponding author.

\item Analyse the images with a browser-based `virtual fission track
  microscope'. This virtual instrument has a simple user interface
  with controls to zoom, pan and focus in or out of the digital image
  stack. Depending on the permissions granted to the user by the
  administrator, the virtual microsocope offers a number of different
  options.  Entry level `ordinary' users are only allowed to count
  tracks by clicking within a pre-defined `region of interest'. In
  contrast, `superusers' are allowed to define their own regions of
  interest. Once the user is satisfied that they have counted all the
  fission tracks in a particular grain, they can submit the results to
  the server. They are then presented with a new set of images until
  all grains are counted.

\item Post-processing. The fission track data can either be downloaded
  as a flat data table of counts and area, or as a \texttt{.json} file
  containing the locations of all the coounted
  tracks. geochron@home does not provide any tools to
  post-process these files. They are meant to be passed on to other
  tools such as spreadsheet applications or IsoplotR
  \citep{vermeesch2018c}.
  
\end{enumerate}
  
The five-step workflow can be used for several applications, including
(1) conventional fission track analysis; (2) archiving published
fission track results; (3) building tutorials; and (4) crowd-sourcing
fission track data. The next sections of this paper will illustrate
these four different applications with real world examples.\medskip

\section{Counting fission tracks in `private mode'}\label{sec:private}

Administrators can define regions of interest (ROI) and count or edit
the fission track coordinates of any grain in a geochron@home
database. They can also assign other users to groups, and give these
groups access to a subset of the projects in the
database. Administrators have fine control over the permissions of the
groups. For example, they can allow the members of a group to count
fission tracks in the predefined ROIs, or to define their own
ROIs. Groups provide a mechanism to compare and combine the results of
multiple analysts of the same sample. Figure~\ref{fig:AvP} illustrates
this with two sets of fission track density estimates (in tracks per
\textmu{m}\textsuperscript{2}) for the same sample of Mount Dromedary
apatite \citep{green1985b}, analysed by two users (PV and AC).\medskip

The two analysts defined their own ROIs, resulting in slightly
different density estimates
(Figure~\ref{fig:AvP}a). Figure~\ref{fig:AvP}b compares the track
density estimates of the two analysts for 25 apatite grains on a
radial plot, using the assumption that the density estimates are
statistically independent from each other. Let $N_{PV}$ and $N_{AC}$
be the number of spontaneous tracks counted by PV and AC over areas
$A_{PV}$ and $A_{AC}$, respectively. Then Figure~\ref{fig:AvP}b
assumes that the ratio of the estimated track densities
$\hat{\rho}_{PV} = N_{PV}/A_{PV}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{AC} =
N_{AC}/A_{AC}$ is associated with the following uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma} =
  \sqrt{\mbox{var}\left(\frac{\hat{\rho}_{PV}}{\hat{\rho}_{AC}}\right)} =
  \frac{\hat{\rho}_{PV}}{\hat{\rho}_{AC}} \, \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{PV}} +
    \frac{1}{N_{PV}} }
  \label{eq:pessimistic}
\end{equation}

In reality, the uncertainties are strongly correlated due to the
significant overlap between the counting areas chosen by the two
analysts. This overlap causes the density ratios to be underdispersed
with respect to the assigned uncertainties ($\mbox{MSWD}=0.34$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:AvP}b).  Equation~\ref{eq:pessimistic} can be modified
to remove the error correlation under the assumption that the two
analysts counted exactly the same features in the overlapping area
($A_0$):
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma}' =
  \frac{\hat{\rho}_{PV}}{\hat{\rho}_{AC}}
  \sqrt{\frac{A_{PV}+A_{AC}}{N_{PV}+N_{AC}}}\,
  \sqrt{
    \frac{1}{A_{PV}} + \frac{1}{A_{AC}} - \frac{2\,A_0}{A_{PV}\,A_{AC}}
  }
  \label{eq:optimistic}
\end{equation}

If there is no overlap between the two counting areas (i.e., if
$A_0=0$), then $\hat{\sigma}' \approx \hat{\sigma}$. Conversely, if
the counting areas are identical (i.e., if $A_{PV}=A_{AC}=A_0$), and
if the two analysts produce perfectly consistent counts, then
$\hat{\sigma}'=0$.\medskip

Equation~\ref{eq:optimistic} produces a radial plot
(Figure~\ref{fig:AvP}c) that is overdispersed ($\mbox{MSWD}=4.2$) with
respect to $\hat{\sigma}'$. This suggests that the assumption of
perfect consistency is also wrong. Detailed inspection of the counted
features in the virtual microscope reveals that the two analysts are
in perfect agreement for long fission tracks, but that they
occasionally disagree about the shorter features. The ratio of the
pooled track densities indicates that PV undercounts the Mount
Dromedary apatite by 7\% relative to AC.
\medskip

In summary, it could be said that Equation~\ref{eq:pessimistic}
represents an overly `pessimistic' view of analysts' abilities to
reproduce each other's results, whereas Equation~\ref{eq:optimistic}
is too `optimistic'. The truth lies between the two scenarios.  The
existence of `observer bias' is well documented \citep{tamer2025}.  It
is one of the reasons why fission track analysis is often done
relative to age standards: observer bias does not have to be a problem
provided that it is consistent between grains, and between
samples.\medskip

    using the `optimistic' error propagation formula of
    Equation~\ref{eq:optimistic}.

\section{The geochron@home archive (GaHa)}\label{sec:GaHa}

Once a set of fission track images has been analysed and the analyst
is confident that the results are accurate, the status of the results
can be changed from private to public. This makes the results visible
over the internet as a list of URLs, where each grain number and user
ID corresponds to a unique address. The geochron@home archive
(GaHa) brings fission track geochronology into the era of FAIR
science. It allows peer reviewers to inspect the raw data from which
thermochronological inferences are made. The archive is open to
submissions from any fission track laboratory, free of charge.
However, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:architecture}, it is also
possible to establish a new archive elsewhere. At the time of writing,
GaHa contains data for three studies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\citet{guo2025}}: this is an LA-ICP-MS based fission track study
  of detrital apatite from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. It
  contains image stacks of semitracks in 1146 apatite grains from 16
  different samples.
\item{\citet{tamer2025}}: this is a round-robin study in which digital
  image stacks of 44 apatite crystals were circulated among 14
  different analysts. These analysts used the FastTrack image analysis
  software (which is part of the Fission Track Studio suite) to define
  their own ROIs and count the semitracks and horizontally confined
  fission tracks in them. GaHa presents the results of the round-robin
  experiment as a ${44}\times{14}$ grid of URLs.
\item{This study}: All the raw fission track data used in this article
  are available on GaHa, along with the post-processing software that
  was used to produce the figures. Together, these resources provide
  the reader with all the information needed to fully reproduce our
  results, `from cradle to grave'. To our knowledge, this is the first
  geochronological study to do so.
\end{enumerate}

\section{geochron@home tutorials}\label{sec:tutorial}

Given the right permissions (assigned by an administrator), users can
build tutorial pages by annotating features in fission track images.
These features can be tracks or other objects such as scratches,
inclusions, dislocations or holes. A selection of tutorial pages is
presented to new users when they first log into
geochron@home. They must complete the tutorial before being
allowed to count fission tracks.  The tutorial pages can be revisited
at any time by visiting the corresponding link on the
geochron@home landing page.\medskip

The annotations in the current tutorial pages were made by an
experienced fission track analyst (Andrew Carter). They provide a
quick and easy mechanism to train novice users in the art of fission
track analysis. At the time of writing, the tutorial pages offer only
a limited degree of interactivity. Users can click on features to read
the annotations. However, future plans include the addition of fully
interactive `quizzes' (see Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}). Despite the
simplicity of the current tutorials, they are already quite effective,
as demonstrated by the crowd-sourcing experiment described in the next
section of this paper.

\section{Crowd-sourcing fission track data}\label{sec:crowdsourcing}

%\begin{figure}[!ht]
{ \centering \includegraphics[width=15cm]{radialcrowd.pdf}
  \captionof{figure}{a) box plots of 25 crowd-sourced sets of fission
    track counts for 70 analysts. b) radial plot comparing the paired
    track counts for the first two grains in the dataset (4649 and
    4673). The estimate of user PV is shown in blue. Analyst AC used a
    different ROI and is not shown.\medskip}
  \label{fig:radialcrowd}
}%\end{figure}

In 1906, Sir Francis Galton visited a county fair in which a contest
was held to guess the weight of an ox. 787 people participated in the
event. Galton discovered that the median of all their estimates was
within 0.8\% of the true weight of the ox and more accurate than 90\%
of the individual estimates. Such is the `wisdom of crowds'
\citep{galton1907a}. Similar effects are seen in fission track
geochronology.\medskip

A 1984 interlaboratory comparison study \citep{miller1985} showed that
the average of several fission track age estimates is closer to the
known age of mineral standards than the age obtained by any individual
observer. Unfortunately, routine measurement of fission track samples
by multiple analysts is prohibitively expensive in a normal laboratory
environment. geochron@home changes this, by bringing fission
track dating to a proverbial `county fair' of citizen
scientists.\medskip

Figure~\ref{fig:crowdsourcing} presents the results of a
crowd-sourcing experiment that was carried out at UCL as part of an
undergraduate course in isotope geology. 70~students were asked to
create an account on the geochron@home server by selecting a
unique username and password. After spending a few minutes to complete
the compulsory tutorial (Section~\ref{sec:tutorial}), the students
were asked to count fission tracks in randomly assigned image stacks
of Mount Dromedary apatite. Each student was required to analyse at
least 15 grains, using pre-defined ROIs. In a matter of hours, the
students amassed a dataset of 37,331 fission track counts in 34
grains. This large dataset was parsed into separate data files --one
for each student-- which they processed during an assessed practical
exercise.\medskip

The raw counts are shown as a series of box plots in
Figure~\ref{fig:crowdsourcing}a for the same selection of 25 grains
that were analysed by AC and PV in Section~\ref{sec:private}. The box
plots exhibit significant variability between the grains and between
the students. This inter-grain variability is expected. It reflects
the different sizes of the ROIs, and the variable U-content of the
grains. The variability of the track counts for each grain results
from observer bias. This phenomenon was previously discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:private}. However, the bias is much stronger for the
crowd-sourced dataset than it was for the two `expert' analysts of
Section~\ref{sec:private}.\medskip

Figure~\ref{fig:crowdsourcing}b compares the 42 raw fission track
counts of the first two grains on a radial plot.  The pairwise ratios
of the counts for each analyst are more consistent than the raw counts
of Figure~\ref{fig:crowdsourcing}a.  Students who over- or undercount
the first grain, tend to over- or undercount the second grain as
well. Nevertheless, the results are overdispersed with respect to the
counting uncertainties, even when using the `pessimistic' scenario of
Equation~\ref{eq:pessimistic}.  The poor consistency of the results
reflects the very limited training received by the students. But
despite these inconsistencies, the opinion of an `expert' (PV, shown
in blue) falls the middle of the estimates obtained by the citizen
scientists. This suggests that the collective wisdom of the entire
group of students is greater than that of any individual
analyst.\medskip

As metioned in Section~\ref{sec:architecture}, geochron@home stores
the actual track positions marked by the users. This raw data can be
downloaded as a \texttt{.json} file and inspected in detail.
Figure~\ref{fig:radialcrowd} is a two-dimensional histogram for the
x-y positions of all the track positions generated by the students in
the two apatite crystals. Visual comparison of the histogram with the
optical image confirms that the students unanimously identified the
most obvious semitracks, which contain a clearly visible etch pit and
tail. Shorter and fainter tracks received fewer clicks. Datasets like
this can be used to replace integer counts of fission tracks with
probabilities, reflecting the ambiguity of some fission track
datasets.\medskip

Figure~\ref{fig:radialcrowd} also shows that some students counted the
tails of the fission tracks rather than their etch pits, despite being
told the opposite in the tutorial. Fixing this issue will require some
improvements to the tutorial pages (Section~\ref{sec:outlook}).

    two grains, as identified by the citizen scientists.
    \medskip}
  \label{fig:crowdsourcing}
}%\end{figure}

\section{Outlook}\label{sec:outlook}

geochron@home has been in development for 10 years and
remains a work in progress. Planned improvements include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Interactive tutorial pages. To ensure that novice users do not
  count the tails but the etch pits of fission tracks, we will add a
  `quiz' to the tutorial pages. Only users who click on the `correct'
  features in an unlabelled set of images will be allowed to count new
  samples.
\item Length measurements. The geochron@home archive already
  contains horizontally confined fission track measurements
  \citep{tamer2025}.  However, these results must be generated
  externally (e.g., using Fission Track Studio) and uploaded via a
  \texttt{.json} file.  The virtual microscope curently lacks the
  functionality to generate length data within
  geochron@home. This functionality will be added in a future
  update.
\item Dpar and Dper. Etch pits are currently stored as simple sets of
  x- and y-coordinates.  In reality, etch pits have a finite length
  (`Dpar') and width (`Dper'), which serve as useful indicators for
  the horizontal etch rates along the c-axis and parallel to it
  \citep{donelick1993}. Functions will be added measure and visualise
  these type of data in geochron@home.
\item Machine learning. Data science is experiencing an artificial
  intelligence revolution that has already started to transform the
  fission track method \citep{nachtergaele2020}.  Convolutional neural
  networks must be trained with example data. geochron@home
  is ideally suited for this task. Section~\ref{sec:crowdsourcing}
  showed how the collective wisdom of multiple fission track analysts
  can label fission track images with probabilities rather than
  counts. This data format is close to the form in which data are
  treated within an AI algorithm.\medskip

  Once trained on historical data, AI algorithms can be used to count
  fission tracks automatically. Following the model of Fission Track
  Studio, machine learning can be used to reverse the fission track
  counting process. Instead of asking users to count the fission
  tracks in a sample, the software can ask them to check the results
  proposed by an AI algorithm, and to remove any features that are
  \emph{not} fission tracks.\medskip

  Regardless of whether fission tracks were counted manually or with a
  machine, the value of the geochron@home archive remains the
  same. It is important to document data so that samples can be
  reanalysed in the future, for example when a new and improved
  generation of machine learning algorithms becomes available.
\end{enumerate}

These four improvements will be made by ourselves pending additional
funding. However, because geochron@home is free and open
software, we invite any interested parties to join the effort and
extend or improve our code.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper introduced geochron@home, a software platform for
FAIR fission track analysis. We demonstrated four different
applications of this platform using real data. Putting the FAIR data
paradigm into practice, all the imagery, counts and source code for
this paper are publicly available. Using these resources, the reader
can reproduce all the results that were presented in this publication.
We hope that other geochronologists will follow this example.  FAIR
data promises to address the reproducibility crisis in science
\citep{miyakawa2020}.\medskip

geochron@home's rich archive of raw data can be reanalysed in
the future. We anticipate that the adoption of FAIR data processing
workflows will open up new research opportunities. For example,
archived pairs of peer-reviewed fission track images and counts could
be used to train the next generation of automated machine learning
algorithms. Conversely, it is also possible that future improvements
in fission track images analysis will be used to update the count data
for published datasets, improved their accuracy.\medskip

Another advantage of the geochron@home wokflow is the
separation of image acquisition and image analysis. This separation
reduces the hardware requirements for fission track dating. It opens
up the possibility to share resources. State-of-the-art digital
microscopes are expensive. Using geochron@home, a single
microscope can serve multiple users and make fission track analysis
more affordable.\medskip

The fission track method has always been a test bed for new
geochronological developments.  Because fission track data are
imprecise, the fission track community has sollicited the help of
statisticians and mathematicians to develop its analytical protocols.
Other geochronological communities are still catching up with concepts
and tools such as overdispersion, mixture modelling and radial plots,
which have been commonplace in fission track dating for decades
\citep{vermeesch2019b}. In a similar vein, the subjective nature of
fission track identification has prompted the fission track community
to organise inter-laboratory comparisons and round-robin studies long
before other geochronological communities
\citep{miller1985,tamer2025}.\medskip

With the development of geochron@home, fission tracks is once
again ahead of the pack in terms of FAIR data analysis.
geochron@home currently only stores images and counts. This
is enough to reproduce the results of fission track studies using the
external detector method, but not for LA-ICP-MS based data. FAIR data
processing of LA-ICP-MS data requires a new generation of mass
spectrometer data reduction software. We are currently working on
this. The development of FAIR ICP-MS data pipelines will not only
benefit fission track dating but other chronometers as well, such as
in-situ U--Pb, Rb--Sr and Lu--Hf \citep{vermeesch2025}.\medskip

With the establishment of FAIR data, the era of `fiction tracks' will
be gone for good, and geochronology will be well placed to avoid the
reproducibility problems that have plagued other fields of science.
