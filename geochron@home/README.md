# Supplementary data and code for "FAIR fission track analysis with geochron@home"

This repository contains the following folders:

1. `json`: the raw fission track data from [geochron@home](https://isoplotr.es.ucl.ac.uk/geochrono@home/ftc)

2. `screenshots`: screen grabs from geochron@home. The actual raw imagery can be viewed on the [geochron@home archive](https://github.com/pvermees/GaHa)

3. `R`: R-scripts to reproduce the figures of the paper using the files in `json` and `screenshots`

4. `output`: the output of the `main.R` script in `R`

To reproduce the figures in the paper (and more), simply download this repository on your computer, navigate the the `R` folder and run `main.R`.
